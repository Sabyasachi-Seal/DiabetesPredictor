# Diabetes Predictor

<hr>

More than 34.2 million people around the globe are suffering with diabetes. There has to be a way to predict if someone is going to get diabetes and start treating it at the earliest. With the increasing demand for doctors, we need something that will help our healthcare system.

<hr>

My Solution is a web application that takes in certain parameters and tells the user if he/she is likely to have diabetes in the future. This will solve the problem of patients finding out too late that they have diabetes and till then they would have already caused a lot of harm to their body. My app, uses machine learning to predict if a user will have diabetes. This machine learning model is made with the help of a diabetes dataset. The app also shows the accuracy percentage of the prediction it has made.
